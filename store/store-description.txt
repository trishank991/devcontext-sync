DevContext Sync - Your AI Coding Memory, Everywhere

Stop re-explaining your codebase every time you switch AI tools. DevContext Sync keeps your project context, code snippets, and AI conversations synchronized between your browser and IDE.

THE PROBLEM

Developers waste 5+ hours per week re-explaining project context to AI assistants. You spend 20 minutes explaining your architecture to ChatGPT. Then you need Claude for a different task. Back to square one. Switch to VS Code Copilot? Start over again.

Your AI assistants have amnesia. DevContext Sync gives them memory.

THE SOLUTION

DevContext Sync creates a persistent layer between you and your AI tools. Save context once, use it everywhere. Your project architecture, coding conventions, and past solutions travel with you across ChatGPT, Claude, VS Code, and Cursor.

KEY FEATURES

- Your React frontend context never bleeds into your Python backend
- Switch projects instantly with the right context loaded
- Store architecture notes, tech stack details, and coding conventions

Searchable Knowledge Base
- Every AI conversation becomes searchable documentation
- Find that solution from three months ago in seconds
- Full-text search across all saved contexts and snippets
- Tag and organize by project, language, or topic

Code Snippet Library
- Save code from AI conversations with one click
- Snippets sync instantly to VS Code and Cursor
- Organize with tags and project associations
- Quick access from the extension popup or IDE

IDE Integration
